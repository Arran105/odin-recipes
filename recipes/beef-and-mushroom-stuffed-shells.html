    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 (16-ounce package) jumbo pasta shells</li>

        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>

        <li>8 ounces button mushrooms, minced</li>

        <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta</li>

        <li>1 large egg</li>

        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>

        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>15 ounces prepared tomato sauce</li>

        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps/Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in shells and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain shells and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms have softened and released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard excess fat. Transfer meat mixture to a separate bowl and allow to cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir ricotta cheese, egg, garlic, and oregano into cooled meat mixture until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 of tomato sauce to the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Fill each shell with about 1 teaspoon meat mixture and place filling-side-up in the baking dish. Repeat with remaining shells and filling. Spread remaining tomato sauce over shells, and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and starting to brown, approximately 25 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
